# Biography
I am PhD student at University of Groningen (The Netherlands) under the supervision of [Dr. Jorge A. Pérez]
and [Prof. Gerard Renardel de Lavalette].
My research work concerns tools for rigorous software development, in particular
techniques for certifying correct and reliable communication-intensive software.

Prior to this, I developed Master thesis on the modular type inference algorithm
for ML-like programming languages in Haskell supervised by [Prof. Silvia Ghilezan] at
the Faculty of Technical Sciences (Novi Sad, Serbia).
